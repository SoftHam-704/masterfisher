# Build Fix Walkthrough

The project build was failing due to an incorrect entry point in [index.html](file:///C:/Users/Systems/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/masterfisher-connect/index.html) and potential compatibility issues with React 19.

## Changes

### Fixed Entry Point
Updated [index.html](file:///C:/Users/Systems/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/masterfisher-connect/index.html) to point to the correct entry file:
```diff
- <script type="module" src="./index.tsx"></script>
+ <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
```

### Downgraded React
Downgraded React and React DOM to version 18.3.1 in [package.json](file:///C:/Users/Systems/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/masterfisher-connect/package.json) to ensure stability and compatibility with Vercel.

## Verification Results

### Automated Build
Ran `npm run build` and confirmed it completes successfully:
```
vite v5.4.19 building for production...
✓ 3515 modules transformed.
...
✓ built in 10.56s
```

The application is now ready for deployment.
